    <h2>University of Cambridge, Murray Edwards College: Student Ambassador</h2>
    In my role as Student Ambassador, I represent the college in tours and outreach initiatives, particularly for women in STEM.

    <h2>Tooled Up Education: Student Specialist</h2>
    <p>After speaking on a 300-audience panel at COBIS (Council of British International Schools Conference), I was hired directly by the CEO to work as a student specialist on technology, specifically deepfakes. I then researched and authored an in-depth article on deepfake technology, exploring mechanisms, applications, and societal implications. Through my work I communicated complex technical concepts in an accessible manner for a wide range of non-technical audiences including students, teachers, and parents. I provided actionable recommendations for educators and parents to increase awareness and mitigate risks associated with deepfake media.</p>
